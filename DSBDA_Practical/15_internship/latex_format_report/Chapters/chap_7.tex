\section{Conclusion}
\justify
\quad
"Voice over IP is the technology of digitizing sound, compressing it, breaking it up into data packets , and sending it over an IP (internet protocol ) network where it is reassembled , decompressed , and converted back into an analog wave form ." The transmission of sound over a packet switched network in this manner is an order of magnitude more efficient than the transmission of sound over a circuit switched network.

\section{Future Scope}
\justify
\quad
Voice over IP (VoIP) is a blanket description for any service that delivers standard voice telephone services over Internet Protocol (IP). Computers to transfer data and the files between computers normally use Internet protocol.
