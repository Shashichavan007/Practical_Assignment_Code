\chapter{Methodology Analysis}
\justify
\quad 
"Voice over IP is the technology of digitizing sound, compressing it, breaking it up into data packets , and sending it over an IP (internet protocol ) network where it is reassembled , decompressed , and converted back into an analog wave form ." The transmission of sound over a packet switched network in this manner is an order of magnitude more efficient than the transmission of sound over a circuit switched network.

\section{User Characteristics}
